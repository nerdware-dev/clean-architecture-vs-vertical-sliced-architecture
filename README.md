# 🍺 Beer Ordering System

Welcome to the Beer Ordering System! This project is a demonstration of the **Vertical Sliced Architecture** approach, contrasting it with the traditional **Clean Architecture**. Let's dive into what makes these architectures unique and how you can get started with this project. 

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean Architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns, making sure that the business logic is independent of frameworks and UI.
- **Layered Approach**: It typically involves multiple layers such as presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure.
- **Testability**: By isolating the core logic, it becomes easier to test.

### Vertical Sliced Architecture
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Vertical Sliced Architecture organizes code by features rather than layers, making it easier to navigate and understand.
- **Focused Development**: Each feature slice contains everything needed for that feature, including UI, business logic, and data access.
- **Scalability**: This approach can be more scalable as it allows teams to work on different features independently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd vertical-sliced-architecture
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start:dev
   ```

3. **Enjoy the Experience**: Once the server is running, you can explore the features and see how the Vertical Sliced Architecture is implemented. 🎉
